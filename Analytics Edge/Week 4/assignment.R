#even if the R2 on the data is very low this doesnot mean that the model is poor. it could mean that the 
#data i am dealing with cannot be modeled with a linear model , i can still derive useful info from the data 
#by looking at the significant independent variables in the model. test R2 is always going to be lower than the
#traning R2 so if the R2 on the training is low then there is no point of doing variable selection for the model.

#for a notoriouly tough data i can still get the important variables using a linear model. also using a tree model
#on a tough data leads to much more interpretability without the much loss of predictive power.
